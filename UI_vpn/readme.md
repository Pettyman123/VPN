<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project demonstrates how to implement a basic Virtual Private Network (VPN) using Python and socket programming. Additionally, it includes a simple UI using Tesseract OCR to visualize the VPN server-client interaction.

<h2>Basic VPN Concepts</h2>
A VPN extends a private network across a public network, ensuring secure data transmission through encryption, tunneling, and authentication.

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Secure Communication: Encrypts data over public networks.</li>
<li>Privacy Protection: Hides IP addresses and online activities.</li>
<li>Access Control: Restricts access to authorized users.</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Ensures data received matches sent data.</li>
<li>Tesseract and OCR Overview</li>
<li>Tesseract OCR is used to create a UI that captures and converts console output screenshots into readable text.</li>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h4>Setup VPN Server and Client:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Run vpn_server.py for the server.</li>
  <li>Run vpn_client.py for the client.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Capture Console Output with Tesseract:</h4>

Run capture_ui.py to capture and convert console output screenshots.

<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<li>Encryption and Decryption: Implementing robust encryption methods.</li>
<li>Network Latency: Managing delays due to encryption/decryption.</li>
<li>Security Vulnerabilities: Addressing potential breaches like man-in-the-middle attacks.</li>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
<li>Enhanced Encryption: Incorporate advanced encryption algorithms.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform Support: Extend VPN to support various platforms.</li>
<li>User Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).</li>
<li>Performance Optimization: Improve VPN performance and throughput.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project serves as a foundational guide to implementing a VPN using Python, socket programming, and integrating Tesseract for basic UI visualization of network communication.
