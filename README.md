## VPN Web Application Using Flask

![Screenshot 2024-07-12 120051](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22f34f15-bc73-4a12-8492-fc9285b3fb3a)


### Introduction
This project demonstrates a simple VPN implemented using Python and socket programming, integrated with a Flask web application for user interaction. The web application allows you to start the VPN server and client, and view their logs in a user-friendly interface.

### Features
- Start VPN Server from the web interface.
- Start VPN Client from the web interface.
- View logs of server-client interactions on the web interface.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

### Usage
1. Run the Flask application.
2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Start the server and client from the web interface and view the logs.

## VPN with UI Using Tesseract

### Introduction
This project integrates Tesseract OCR to create a user interface that captures and visualizes the interaction between the VPN server and client. It demonstrates the power of OCR technology in creating a dynamic UI.

### Features
- Capture and convert console output screenshots into readable text using Tesseract OCR.
- Visualize VPN server-client interactions in a user-friendly UI.
- Enhance the usability and monitoring of VPN operations.

### Usage
1. Run the VPN server and client scripts.
2. Use the Tesseract OCR script to capture and visualize the logs.

### Introduction
A straightforward implementation of a VPN using Python and socket programming. This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of VPN, such as secure communication, encryption, and data integrity.

### Features
- Secure communication over public networks.
- Basic encryption and decryption of messages.
- Simple and effective implementation of VPN principles.

### Usage
1. Run the `vpn_server.py` script to start the server.
2. Run the `vpn_client.py` script to start the client.
3. Observe the secure communication between server and client.
