<h2>Introduction</h2>
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. This guide explains how to implement a basic VPN using Python and socket programming, providing secure communication and privacy.

<h2>Basic VPN Concepts</h2>
<li>VPN Overview: Extends a private network across a public network, allowing secure data transmission.</li>
<li>Encryption: Ensures data transferred over the network is secure from eavesdroppers.</li>
<li>Tunneling: Encapsulates one type of data packet within another, hiding the original packet and adding a layer of security.</li>
<li>Authentication: Verifies the identity of users or devices before granting access to the VPN.</li>

<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Secure Communication: Encrypts and securely transmits data over public networks.</li>
<li>Privacy Protection: Hides the user's IP address and online activities.</li>
<li>Access Control: Restricts access to authorized users.</li>
<li>Data Integrity: Ensures that the data received is the same as the data sent.</li>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
Python 3.x installed.
Basic understanding of Python and socket programming.
<h3>Files</h3>
<li>vpn_server.py: Handles incoming client connections, receives and decrypts messages, and sends encrypted responses.</li>
<li>vpn_client.py: Connects to the server, sends encrypted messages, and receives and decrypts responses.</li>

<h3>Running the VPN</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    Start the VPN server :
    <i>python vpn_server.py</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Start the VPN CLient :
    <i>python vpn_client.py</i>
  </li>
</ol>
